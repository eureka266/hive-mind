**Turn every product discussion into a structured, version-controlled, team-shared knowledge base.**

A two-hour meeting ends, conclusions live in a few heads. Three weeks later, nobody remembers *why* you cut that approach. New hires can't piece together the "why" from scattered chats and agreements.

**Discussions are real-time; knowledge leaks away.** HiveMind captures it: every product chat becomes traceable, durable, reusable facts, decisions, and workflows — versioned in Git, shared with your team.

## Core Capabilities

| Capability | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| **Auto-extract discussions** | `/prd` chat about needs → AI auto-splits into facts, decisions, workflows. No manual spec writing. Inspired by [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack). |
| **Structured knowledge base** | All outputs land in Git repo (`facts/`, `decisions/`, `features/`, `memory/`, `assets/`, etc.) — versioned, traceable, team-shared. |
| **Proactive memory** | Auto-load related rules and decisions before discussion. Auto-suggest which rules to save after. Inspired by [Trellis](https://github.com/mindfold-ai/trellis). |
| **Complete workflow** | From discussion → PRD, review, prototype, dev handoff, GTM content, email, and product videos (demo/tutorial/marketing) — end-to-end. |
| **Content generation** | `/gtm` for positioning, `/email` for campaigns, `/video` for demo/tutorial videos with brand-aware animation using Remotion. All persist to knowledge base. |
| **Team sharing** | Knowledge base is your own private Git repo. Team clones it, and every decision, rule, video, and history is there. New hires onboard 3x faster. |

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**
- [ ] **Node.js** (with `npx`) — to install: `node -v`
- [ ] **Git** 2.20+ — knowledge base uses Git: `git --version`
- [ ] **Claude Code or Codex** — either works

**Install**
```bash
npx skills add eureka266/HiveMind
```

Works with both **Claude Code** and **Codex** right away. Talk naturally and HiveMind listens.

> Want native slash commands (`/prd`, `/dev`, `/ui-draft`), auto-update, and team setup? See [Team Setup](#team-setup-optional) below.

## How your team uses it

**Product Manager**
```
/prd bulk-import feature              # discuss requirements → AI extracts facts, decisions, workflows
/prd review payment-flow              # PRD review: challenge scope, premises, and "6-month regret" risks
/prd research why users churn in March # synthesize analytics, support tickets, and interview notes
/prd docs export-feature              # generate user-facing help docs from PRD
/prd competitor chainalysis           # structured competitive analysis saved to knowledge base
```

**Engineer**
```
/dev bulk-import                      # generate handoff: implementation plan, API contracts, test specs, checklist
/dev bulk-import challenge            # adversarial review: find edge cases and missing error handling
```

**Designer**
```
/ui-draft payment flow optimization   # turn interaction discussion into a clickable single-file HTML prototype
/ui-draft bulk-import --figma         # generate prototype and sync frames to Figma
```

**Marketing / GTM**
```
/gtm how we compare to competitors    # generate positioning doc, sales talk tracks, one-pagers
/video dashboard analytics demo       # generate product demo video: script → confirm → code → render
/video --tutorial csv-import          # create tutorial video explaining step-by-step feature usage
/email product-update May             # draft product update email as ready-to-send HTML
/email free-user-upgrade-nudge        # trigger-based email: quota warning, upsell copy
```

Natural language also works: "let's discuss bulk import", "extract the key decisions from that meeting", "write a product blog post from the knowledge base".

## What your knowledge base looks like after a few months

Every HiveMind command writes into a structured Git repo. Here's what a real product team's knowledge base looks like after steady use:

```

The repo is fully yours — HiveMind writes to it, but never reads it remotely or uploads anything. Your team clones it; new hires read `facts/` and `decisions/` to get up to speed without onboarding calls.

## What happens in one discussion

One `/prd bulk-import` and your team walks away with:

```
✅ Committed and pushed

  ✓ facts/your-product.md              (updated)
  ✓ workflows/csv-import.yaml           (new)
  ✓ decisions/decision-20260617-csv-import.md
  ✓ features/csv-import/prd.md          (new)
  ✓ features/csv-import/workflow.yaml   (new)

Next: /ui-draft payment optimization  → clickable HTML prototype
```

Knowledge base structure:
- **facts/** — product facts, boundaries, limits (e.g., "max 10k rows per import")
- **decisions/** — design decisions and rejected approaches, with rationale (you'll find "why" three weeks later)
- **workflows/** — interaction specs (state machines, components, validation rules)
- **features/[feature]/** — PRD, prototype, dev assets, session memory all in one place
- **memory/** — reusable cross-feature rules, user research, discussion logs

## Where the knowledge base lives

By default, local-only at `~/team-knowledge` (zero setup, works offline). When you're ready to share, point it to your own private Git repo:

```bash
KNOWLEDGE_REPO=your-org/team-knowledge bash ~/HiveMind/claude-code/install.sh
```

Your data stays yours — HiveMind never uploads, stores, or holds anything.

## Team setup (optional)

Want native slash commands, auto-update via hook, and multi-person collaboration? Clone and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eureka266/HiveMind.git ~/HiveMind
bash ~/HiveMind/claude-code/install.sh      # Claude Code (terminal & VS Code)
# or
bash ~/HiveMind/codex/install.sh            # Codex
```

Details: [`claude-code/README.md`](./claude-code/README.md), [`codex/README.md`](./codex/README.md), [`claude-code/ENTERPRISE_SETUP.md`](./claude-code/ENTERPRISE_SETUP.md).

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `npx skills add` not found | Check Node/npx installed (`npx -v`), network can reach GitHub, command is `npx skills add eureka266/HiveMind` |
| No `/prd` command / commands don't work | `npx skills add` installs a generic skill that listens for natural language. For native `/prd` use [Team Setup](#team-setup-optional) and restart your session |
| Push failed (permission denied) | Ensure you can write to the knowledge repo (your own repo or team org grants access); or skip `KNOWLEDGE_REPO` for local-only mode |
| Lost mid-discussion changes | Re-run `/prd [feature]` — HiveMind auto-detects and offers recovery |
| How do I view the HTML prototype? | Claude Code: `open <knowledge-repo>/features/[feature]/prototype.html`; VS Code: use Live Preview extension |
| `/ui-draft` returns `python: command not found` | Some systems lack `python` command (e.g., macOS has only `python3`). Create symlink: `sudo ln -sf $(which python3) /usr/local/bin/python`. Verify with `python --version` |

## Acknowledgements

**Proactive memory** is inspired by [Trellis](https://github.com/mindfold-ai/Trellis/tree/main)'s spec → task workspace → journal → finish loop: structured context flows *into* each session automatically, and new learnings are promoted *back* into persistent rules after the session ends. HiveMind applies this pattern to the PM workflow:

- **Session start** — load `memory/rules/` (reusable product rules) and the relevant `features/[feature]/` workspace into context automatically
- **During discussion** — track newly discovered facts, decisions, and reusable principles
- **Memory Review Gate (before finishing)** — present candidate rules to the PM; nothing is written until approved
- **Approved rules** — saved to `memory/rules/`, available as context in every future session on this product

The result: each `/prd` session gets smarter about your product's constraints and decisions without the PM having to repeat them.

**Questioning logic** in `/prd` — one question at a time, knowledge base loaded before asking, no sycophancy, no moving on until you've answered concretely — is inspired by [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack)'s `/office-hours`. The `/prd review` command draws from gstack's `/plan-ceo-review`: premise challenge, scope risk, and adversarial "would you regret this in 6 months?" framing applied to product decisions. Thank you [@garrytan](https://github.com/garrytan).

## Safety & scope

- HiveMind reads/writes **only** your specified local knowledge directory and Git repo; uploads to nowhere.
- You approve all file writes, commits, and pushes before they happen.
- `/email` only generates content and HTML — never sends mail, never reads credentials.
